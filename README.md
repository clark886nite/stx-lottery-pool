 STX Lottery Pool

 **STX Lottery Pool** is a decentralized lottery smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain.  
Participants can buy tickets with STX, and an admin triggers a winner draw. The winner claims the prize pool.

 How It Works

1 Users call `buy-ticket` to enter the lottery and transfer STX.  
2 Admin calls `draw-winner` to select a winner (selection logic can be enhanced with off-chain randomness).  
3 Winner calls `claim-prize` to receive the prize pool.  
4 New lottery rounds can be started manually or via contract reset logic.

 Notes

- All payments are in micro-STX (1 STX = 1,000,000 micro-STX).
- Winner selection is manually triggered; no built-in randomness (off-chain integration recommended).
- Contract requires off-chain automation for drawing and periodic management.
